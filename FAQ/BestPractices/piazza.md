# Common Piazza Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

The purpose of Piazza in this course is twofold. In addition to helping to disseminate information and to answer common questions, your instructors hope that you will engage in thoughtful, constructive discussion about the technologies and methods presented in this course.

Unfortunately, Piazza's Q&A format isn't a perfect solution, and both students and instructors might occasionally find themselves in situations where they struggle to communicate effectively. 

To help alleviate that problem, please read the following list of issues. These are common mistakes which can make it harder for yourself and others to learn and communicate effectively on Piazza. To encourage more constructive communication, there are also some suggestions as to what you can do or say instead in each situation.

1. ### _"Never mind, I figured it out."_

	If you ask a question, but then figure out the answer, please don't just end the discussion with a "never mind". It is possible that other students might have the same problem you have, and that they are hoping to find an answer just like you were.
	
	Instead of leaving those people without a solution, post the answer to your own question. Not only does this help other students, but it's also helpful for your instructors to understand the problems that students are having and how those problems were solved.
	
1. ### _"I'm having the same problem."_

	It's bound to happen that you will encounter the same problem as somebody else. It's also likely that you will not be the first person to ask the question on Piazza. It's great to let others know that you want to be a part of a discussion, but if you choose to do so, **you should not use the student answer section** to say that. It isn't constructive to answer somebody's question that way, and it only makes it harder for folks to find an answer when their problem is marked as solved.
	
	Instead, post a *follow-up* to the discussion saying that you experienced the same problem, and feel free to contribute any additional information you have there. It's also possible that your issue is similar, but not exactly the same, and the follow-up thread will allow you to continue the discussion after the original question is answered.

1. ### Answering in the Follow-ups

    Sometimes, when a question requires additional details, a topic will work its way into the follow-up discussions before coming upon an answer. This is great, but it is still missing something.
	
	Once an answer is decided, either the person who answered the question or the person who asked it, should update the Student Answer section with the result. If you are updating the Student Answer using somebody else's contribution, be sure to credit them for it, even if they posted anonymously.

1. ### Asking questions which already have an answer elsewhere

	Duplicate questions pose a lot of issues for a format such as Piazza, such as:
	
	- The same questions might be answered differently, which can lead to unnecessary confusion.
	- Continuing an existing discussion on a topic is almost certainly more productive than starting over from scratch with a new discussion.
	- Your instructors and classmates have a limited amount of time in their daily lives. Spending that time to answer the same questions over and over again is a bit wasteful, and it can be very frustrating. Please help us and your fellow students to minimize that as much as we can.

	To avoid this, before asking a question, do your best to see if the question has already been asked somewhere else. Here are a few places you can look before asking:
	
	- **Previous Piazza posts**: There's a handy search box above the list of topics that you can use to help you find questions relevant to yours. Be sure to check there first.
	- **Course materials**: Your instructors go through a lot of effort to put together documents and slides in order to help you learn. Please be sure you are caught up with the relevant lectures and documents before asking a question about the material that they cover.
	- **Google** (or your other favorite search engine): The internet is a vast repository of knowledge, and many of your questions might already be answered there. Even if an article or site doesn't have _exactly_ what you need, it might have helpful information that can help you better formulate your question when you post it.

1. ### Asking for homework solutions

	Asking your fellow students to tell you how to answer a problem can quickly cross the line into **cheating**. Likewise, it is important not to answer these sorts of questions since they put you at risk of the same penalties.
	
	Instead, try to choose a specific issue about the problem you do not understand and ask a question about that. Such questions might look like...
	
	> "I don't exactly understand the first step in this algorithm. Can somebody explain what it means to do X?"
	
	or
	
	> "I am receiving the following compiler error, but I don't understand why. Can somebody clarify what is wrong with this syntax?"
	
	If all else fails, and you can't find a way to ask a about a specific part of the problem, attend your instructors' office hours. They won't be able to give you solutions or tell you how to write your program, but they _can_ help you break it down into smaller chunks which you can get help with.
