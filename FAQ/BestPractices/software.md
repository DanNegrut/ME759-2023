## Other Requirements

- [WiscVPN](https://it.wisc.edu/services/wiscvpn/) or [CoE VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/cae/page.php?id=5573)

Additionally, you will need some type of Code Editor, Git Client, and SSH Client to complete your assignments. [See below](#recommended-client-software) for the implementations recommended by your instructors.

## Recommended Client Software

The following software packages are recommended by your instructors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode)
    - Useful as a text editor, but **NOT recommended for Euler!** 
	- This should not be confused with _Visual Studio 2022_, the MS Windows compiler/IDE suite.
- OpenSSH (`ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`)
	- [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) native client
	- macOS and Linux native clients are usually available by default
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL2)
