### Login Gitlab
1. Access the GitLab instance by opening [https://git.doit.wisc.edu/](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/) with your browser.
1. Login using the bottom-right button, the UW-Madison NetID login option.
1. Create your HW repo as instructed in class, add all instructors as collaborators as instructed in class. The instructors need at least Reporter access, but it is safe to give higher access such as Maintainer to them.
1. Clone your HW repo somewhere, such as your local machine, so you can work on it. You may need to set up your Personal Access Token to clone with HTTPS.

### Turning in Homework
All source code files should be located in the appropriate `HWXX` directory with no subdirectories. We will grade the latest commit on the `main` branch as cloned at the due time of the assignment. If you have any doubt about what will be received for grading, you can clone a new copy of your repo and you will see exactly what we will see for grading.

### Git Basics

Stage `file` for commit:
```
git add file
```

Commit all staged files:
```
git commit -m "my message"
```

Update the remote (GitLab instance) with all of your local commits:
```
git push
```

Update your local repository with all commits on the remote (GitLab instance):
```
git pull
```

If you wish to make sure you see what you want us to see after you submit, you can check your homework submission by cloning and inspecting it
```
git clone your_hw_repo_url hw_check
cd hw_check
```
Then, look through the contents of `hw_check` this is exactly what we will see for grading, no more, no less. Any *code* files asked for in the homework must be in here and correctly named with the correct file structure according to the assignment header. Canvas submissions of code are not a backup and will be ignored. Things like plots and written answers go to Canvas.


#### Typical Workflow
1. Edit and add files until you reach a good milestone
1. `git add` modified and new files
1. `git commit` to save the milestone
1. `git push` to update the remote
1. Repeat until you're done with the homework tasks
1. Check your homework submission
